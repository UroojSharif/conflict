### conflict
some work inside it
- To simply create a branch we will use command
`git branch name`
- then if we want to switch to that branch we will use  command `git checkout name`
- But if u want to create and switch in new branch then use `git checkout -b name`
- how to del a branch
   `Çµit branch -d name`
- The branches have the copy of work from main or/ other branch from where it is created. But they will have no idea  if the main or their parent branch is update.
 - How we check that we are in wgich remote repo?
 - `git remote -v`
 - How to add remote repo to local repo?
  `git remote add origin llinkofremoterepo`
  - How to remove the connection to remote repo from local?
  `git remote remove origin`
